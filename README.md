Hello.

This is an application to scrape WoW logs for the guild Speedkill, and to display them a bit better than is currently done.

NOTE:
You need to install node and npm first, which are available in a single installer. Search install node on google.

To use the application, you can just open Run Application.
It will bring up a console window, which will go and get the data to be used in the application. Running the Apollo version takes quite a while.
When that is done, the display application will launch in your browser.
